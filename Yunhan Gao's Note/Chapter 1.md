# Ch1-Introduction
## Software Products(两种软件类型的区别)
### Generic products (PC software such as Photoshop)
**开发者做决定**
- Stand-alone systems that are marketed and sold to any customer who wishes to buy them.
- The specification of what the software should do is owned by the  software developer and decisions on software change are made by the developer.
### Customized products (air traffic control software)
**用户做决定**
- Software that is commissioned by a specific customer to meet their own needs.
- The specification of what the software should do is owned by the  customer for the software and they make decisions on software changes that are required.

## Software Process Activities (软件过程四个活动) 
1. **Software specification**: where customers and engineers define the software that is to be produced and the constraints on its operation.
2. **Software development**: where the software is designed and programmed.
3. **Software validation**: where the software is checked to ensure that it is what the customer requires.
4. **Software evolution**: where the software is modified to reflect changing customer and market requirements.

## 软件特性（3C1I）
- Conformity (一致性)
- Invisibility (不可见性)
- Complexity (复杂性)
- Changeability (演化性)

## ISO 9126 Software Quality Characteristics (质量特性)

| **Functionality**       | Are the required functions available in the software?        |
