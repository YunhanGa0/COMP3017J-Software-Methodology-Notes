## Software Products(两种软件类型的区别)
### Generic products (PC software such as Photoshop)
**开发者做决定**
- Stand-alone systems that are marketed and sold to any customer who wishes to buy them.
- The specification of what the software should do is owned by the  software developer and decisions on software change are made by the developer.
### Customized products (air traffic control software)
**用户做决定**
- Software that is commissioned by a specific customer to meet their own needs.
- The specification of what the software should do is owned by the  customer for the software and they make decisions on software changes that are required.

## Software Process Activities (软件过程四个活动) 
1. **Software specification**: where customers and engineers define the software that is to be produced and the constraints on its operation.
2. **Software development**: where the software is designed and programmed.
3. **Software validation**: where the software is checked to ensure that it is what the customer requires.
4. **Software evolution**: where the software is modified to reflect changing customer and market requirements.

## Software Quality Characteristics (质量特性)

| Functionality       | Are the required functions available in the software?        |
| :------------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Reliability**     | How reliable is the software?                                |
| **Usability**       | Is the software easy to use?                                 |
| **Efficiency**      | How efficient is the software?                               |
| **Maintainability** | How easy is to modify the software?                          |
| **Portability**     | How easy is to transfer the software to another environment? |
