# Ch3-Agile Software Development 
## Agile Manifesto (敏捷宣言：IWCR)
- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools (个人和交互优于过程和工具)
- Working software over comprehensive documentation (可以工作的软件胜过全面的文档)
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation (客户协作优先于合同谈判)
- Responding to change over following a plan (对变化做出反应由于跟随计划)

## Agile Method Applicability (敏捷方法适应情况)
- Development of a **small** or **medium-sized** product
- **Custom system development** within an organization, where there is a clear commitment from the **customer to become involved in the development process** and where there are ***few external rules and regulations that affect the software***.

## Agile Development Techniques
### Extreme Programming(XP)
**Def:** Extreme Programming (XP) takes an ‘extreme’ approach to iterative development.
Key Practices:
- User stories for specification
- Refactoring
- Test-first development
- Pair programming

### Pair Programming
**Def:** Pair programming involves programmers working in pairs, developing code together.
Inplement:
- In pair programming, programmers sit together at the **same computer** to develop the software.
- **Pairs are created dynamically** so that all team members work with each other during the development process.
- The **sharing of knowledge** that happens during pair programming is very important as it reduces the overall risks to a project when team members leave.
**Benefits:**
- This helps develop common ownership of code and spreads knowledge across the team. (传播知识)
- It serves as an informal review process as each line of code is looked at by more than 1 person. (可当作非正式审查)
- It encourages refactoring as the whole team can benefit from improving the system code. (鼓励Refactor)

### Scrum
**Def:** A framework within which people can address complex adaptive problems, while productively and creatively delivering products of the highest possible value.
**Scrum中三种角色：**
- **Product Owner** (green figure):
The “What”: with a focus on value, time to market, return on investment.
- **Development Team** (red figures)
The "How”: focus on building something that is useable and potentially releasable.
- **Scrum Master** (blue figure)
A facilitator who arranges daily meetings, tracks the backlog of work to be done, records decisions, measures progress against the backlog.

**Scrum Theory**(四种会议)：
- Sprint Planning
- Daily Scrum
- Sprint Review
- Sprint Retrospective

### Scrum VS XP

| Scrum                                                        | XP                                                           |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Typically from two weeks to one month long.                  | Typically one or two weeks long.                             |
| Do not allow changes in their timelines.                     | Allow changes in their set timelines.                        |
| Scrum emphasizes self-organization.                          | Extreme Programming emphasizes strong engineering practices  |
| In Scrum framework, team determines the sequence in which the product will be developed. | In Extreme Programming, team have to follow a strict priority order or pre-determined priority order. |
| Scrum framework is not fully described. If you want to adopt it then you need to fill the framework with your own frameworks method like XP or Kanban. | Extreme Programming can be directly applied to a team. XP is also known for its ready-to-apply features. |
