# Ch4-Requirements Engineering
## User/System requirements
### User requirements
- Statements in natural language plus diagrams of the services the system provides and its operational constraints
### System requirements
- A structured document setting out detailed descriptions of the system’s functions, services and operational constraints. Defines what should be implemented so may be part of the contract between the system buyer and the software developers.

## Functional/Non-functional Requirements
### Functional Requirements
- Describe functionality or system services.
- **Functional user requirements** may be high-level statements of what the system should do.
- **Functional system requirements** should describe the system services in detail.

### Non-functional Requirements
- Non-functional requirements usually specify or constrain characteristics of the system as a whole. (约束)
- Non-functional requirements **may be more critical** than functional requirements. If these are not met, the system may be useless.

### Functional vs Non-functional

## Requirements Engineering Processes (三个主要活动)
Requirements engineering involves **three key activities**:
1. Discovering requirements by interacting with stakeholders **(elicitation and analysis)**
2. Converting these requirements into a standard form **(specification)**
3. Checking that the requirements actually define the system that the customer want **(validation)**
